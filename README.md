# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This is my DSA Project of 3rd Semester
This code takes a bunch of words from the user and gives the dictionary order as the output
Also it facilitates the searching of certain words presence in that bunch of words
Working:
We Insert the input word in the AVL tree by comparing the ASCII values of the 1st string literal, if found same then compare the ASCII values of 2nd string literal and so on
Then we simply traverse the tree with the help of Inorder Traversal Function 
Dictionary order is basically the inorder traversal of this AVL tree
